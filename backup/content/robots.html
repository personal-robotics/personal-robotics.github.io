        <p>Build Robots That Belong to You</p>
        <p>Our DIY robot kits are open, modular, and made to grow with you.</p>
        <p>Crafted from eco-friendly laser-cut wood and built around standardized, widely available components, these robots are perfect for learning, hacking, and serious prototyping. Whether you’re running ROS, Python, Arduino—or all three—you stay in full control of the software.</p>
        <p>No lock-ins. No black boxes. Just real robotics, in your hands.</p>
        <p>You can download <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/persalkowitsch/designs">the files needed to laser cut the parts yourself</a>, <a href="https://www.tindie.com/stores/personalrobotics/">or order them from us</a> and support our work</p>

        <p>Meet Our Humanoid: Open, Expressive, and Ready to Evolve</p>
        <p>Standing 65 cm tall, our humanoid platform is compact, expressive, and built for real experimentation. </p>
        <p>With 25 degrees of freedom powered by standard servo motors, she moves with surprising nuance—whether you’re testing gestures, locomotion, or interaction.</p>
        <p>Her digital eyes aren’t just displays—they’re windows into emotion and intent. Behind them, there’s space for a camera module and the onboard brain of your choice: Raspberry Pi, Nvidia Jetson Orin, or any standard SBC.</p>
        <p>Every part is designed for flexibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open source firmware and control software</li>
            <li>Modular hardware</li>
            <li>Laser-cut, eco-friendly frame</li>
            <li>Hackable from day one</li>
        </ul>
        <p>She’s more than a robot. She’s a platform for learning, research, and human-robot interaction—scalable, ethical, and yours to command.</p>

        <p>Rubrick: The Tiny Biped With a Big Personality</p>
        <p>At just 25 cm tall, Rubrick is a small, agile bipedal robot packed with possibility.</p>
        <p>Powered by an ESP32-CAM, he features 6 degrees of freedom, a built-in camera, motion sensor, and a piezo speaker for expressive audio cues. 
            <p>Whether he's patrolling a space, reacting to movement, or playing a tune, Rubrick punches well above his size.</p>
            <p>He's designed for total control—no black boxes, no vendor lock-in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Runs on ESPHome, micro-ROS, Arduino, or your own code</li>
                <li>Easy to modify, extend, and reprogram</li>
                <li>Works great as a standalone bot or as part of a swarm</li>
                <li>Fully open-source, with standardized parts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Rubrick is your pocket-sized platform for walking robots, edge AI, or just having a robot that can dance and watch the door.</p>
