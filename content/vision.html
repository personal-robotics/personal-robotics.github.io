        <p>The age of embodied artificial intelligence is coming. But who will control it?</p>

        <p>Today, robotics is dominated by industrial giants. </p>

        <p>Closed systems, proprietary software, corporate ownership. </p>
        
        <p>The tools that could change our lives</p>
        
        <p>—help us move, see, understand, care, </p>
        <p>are locked behind licenses and surveillance. </p>
        <p>What should be our companions are designed as data farms. </p>
        <p>What should be ours belongs to them.</p>

        <p>We believe in a different future.</p>

        <p>Robots are personal devices. </p>
        <p>They move through our homes, watch over our families, listen to our voices, and see our faces. </p>
        <p>They are not search engines. They are not ad platforms. </p>
        <p>They do not belong in the hands of corporations who harvest data as a business model.</p>

        <p>We are building the open standard for personal robotics. </p>
        <p>A platform that is transparent, secure, and owned by the people who use it.</p>

        <p>We are not here to build toys. We are here to turn tools into companions. 
        <p>From factories to caretaking facilities, from the workplace to the living room, </p>
        <p>we believe robotics should serve humans—not track them.</p>

        <p>Our systems are open source. Our designs are auditable. Our environments are closed and contained by default, protecting against cyber attacks and malevolent code. 
        <p>Your robot should know you—not sell you. Your data stays yours. Always.</p>

        <p>We are reclaiming robotics from the corporations. We are democratizing robotics.</p>

        <p>Let’s build a world where robots are trusted partners, not corporate assets.</p>

        <p>Let’s build it together.</p>
