    <h1>Democratizing Robotics</h1>
    <div class="manifesto-text">
        <p>Robots are becoming part of our everyday lives. </p>
        <p>But most are built by corporations, </p>
        <p>designed to harvest data, locked into closed systems. </p>
        <p>They serve business models—not people.</p>

        <p>We believe robots should be open, transparent, and personal.</p>
        
        <p>We are building a universal, open-source platform for embodied AI.</p>
        <p>Tools that live in your home, belong to you and respect your privacy.</p>
        
        <p>No hidden tracking. No corporate control. Just powerful, human-centered machines that work for you—and only you.</p>
        
        <p>This is your robot.</p>
        <p>These are your rules.</p>
        <p>This is Personal Robotics.</p>
